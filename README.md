This is nori, with the hydrus api hacked in. It is shitty code, but it werks.



Not all features are fully supported, because hydrus api works differently from most booru apis.

(No pagination, and search only returns ids)


To use, insert token into "password" field, and something random into the username field (i was to lazy to change the requirement for none or both).
